description: Run Drizzle push/migrate for this project with a safety gate.
allowed-tools: Bash(pnpm *)

Check that `src/integrations/database/` exists before running — database must be wired up first (`templatecentral:add (database)`).

- `pnpm db:push` — dev only, no migration files generated (schema overwrite)
- `pnpm db:migrate` — production-safe, generates migration files

Before running against production: verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` points to the correct instance.

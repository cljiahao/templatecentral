## Always-on invariants (survive compaction)
1. Secrets are never read or written by the agent — .env*, secrets/** and .secrets/** are guarded.
2. Run the quality gate (typecheck + tests) before declaring any task done.
3. Work on a feature branch — never commit directly to main/uat/develop.
4. Protected files — AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, Dockerfile, .claude/settings.json, .claude/hooks/*, docs/CONSTITUTION.md — require human approval.
5. Respect the architecture/dependency boundaries documented in AGENTS.md and docs/CONSTITUTION.md.

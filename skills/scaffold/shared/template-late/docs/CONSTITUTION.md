# CONSTITUTION.md

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the non-negotiable invariants for **__TC_PROJECT_TITLE__**.
It applies to all contributors — human and AI agent alike. When `AGENTS.md`,
templateCentral skills, or any other guidance conflicts with this document,
**this document wins**. No PR may be merged that violates these rules without
an explicit `## Human Approval Override` section in the PR description.

## 2. Architecture Invariants

[Define the load-bearing architectural rules: layering, module boundaries,
factory/composition-root patterns, forbidden cross-imports, etc.]

## 3. Security Invariants

- Secrets NEVER appear in code, git, logs, or build output — use environment
  variables loaded from a secrets manager.
- All API routes authenticate before executing business logic.
- All mutations write to an audit log.

## 4. Testing Invariants

- New services must have integration tests (success, error, at least one edge case).
- New API routes must have route tests covering 401, 200, and at least one error path.
- CI must stay green — no PR may be merged with failing tests.

## 5. Git & PR Invariants

- Branch from `main`. Protected branches (`main`, `uat`, `develop`) — no direct commits.
- Every PR to `uat` and `main` requires the PR template fully filled.

## 6. Agent Governance Rules

### Protected files — human approval required

The following files require explicit human approval noted in the PR under
`## Protected File Changes`. Agents MUST NOT modify them without approval.

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — agent instruction files
- `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` — this document
- `.claude/settings.json` — harness wiring
- `.claude/hooks/*` — enforcement hooks
- `Dockerfile`
[Add project-specific protected files here]

### Behavioural rules

- Run the quality gate (see delta table for stack-specific command) before declaring any task done.
- Never use `--no-verify` on commits — this bypasses pre-commit hooks.
- Work on a feature branch — never commit directly to `main`, `uat`, or `develop`.
